# Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of core data structures using the C programming language. It's designed to help learners understand how data is stored, manipulated, and accessed at a low level.

## 📘 Overview

Whether you're a student preparing for interviews or an enthusiast looking to master C programming, this collection of code offers a practical approach to learning:

- Basic to intermediate data structures
- Hands-on implementation without library dependencies
- Useful for strengthening problem-solving and algorithmic thinking

## 📂 Topics Covered

- Arrays  
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- Stacks  
- Queues (Simple, Circular, Priority)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler (on Linux)
- Basic knowledge of C programming

### Compile & Run

To compile and run an example:

```bash
gcc linked_list.c -o linked_list
./linked_list

    Replace linked_list.c with the file you want to compile.
